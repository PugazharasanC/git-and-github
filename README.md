# git-and-github


This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub.

Things I did for making this repository.

+ Created an empty repository named `git-and-github` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the page titiled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are
```
echo "# git-and-github" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PugazharasanC/git-and-github.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After Opened CMD, I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
  + This First line `echo "# git-and-github" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `"# git-and-github"`.
